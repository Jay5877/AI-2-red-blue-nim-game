My eval function is that the computer will decide based on the no of sum of marbles at the utility node being even or odd.
If the player at last node would be maximing than it would returning the same value as normal minmax if the sum of marbles will be
even and negative in the case of number being odd.
This same fucntionality will be happening in the min player at the last node but the only change would be that in case of sum being 
even it would return the value with a negation to it.
The logic behind this eval function is that the computer would come to know about the game chances based on the eval value which gets 
returned as negative and positive where if positive is returned for a min player meaning the human will be winning and vice vera.
And the case for maximing player happens the same way except that for maximing player positive value means win for computer.
